# Player Plushies Mod



## TODO (in order):
* Bugs (urgent)
  * Fix outer skin layer. Should it be closer to the model?
  * Support Steve model. Alex works fine, but Steve has holes. Verify this because I only tested one skin.
  * Fix different pixel size. The head which is 1:1 scale, everything else which is smaller, and then the side 
  of the torso is two pixels wide.
* Features
  * Water loggable 
  * Default skin/texture
  * 🏳️‍⚧️ fluffy shark plushie (blahaj)
  * If placed on bed, use a model that is lower on the Y coordinate so it looks like the plushie is on the bed nicely
* Stretch features
  * Custom holding animation like how some blahaj mods use the crossbow position
  * Support older versions of NeoForge
  * Dinnerbone should be upside down, and jeb_ should maybe be rainbow or spinny
