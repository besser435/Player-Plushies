# Player Plushies Mod

sort this by priority later

* should not be block entities to avoid being slow. should behave like player heads
* should have default skin/texture
* water loggable
* 🏳️‍⚧️ fluffy shark plushie easter egg
* dinnerbone should be upside down, and jeb should maybe be rainbow or spinny
* needs good, mass market appeal name ("Player Plushies" perhaps?)
* only really need to support neoforge, but should be backported to older versions
* player heads have static and non static versions, plushies should probably be static
* should support alex model, but also work with steve model
* custom holding animation like how some blahaj mods use the crossbow position
* if placed on bed use a model that is lower on the Y coordinate so it looks like the plushie is on the bed nicely
